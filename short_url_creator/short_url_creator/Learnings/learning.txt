1) To create an endpoint, we must put "/"(forward slash) symbol. Then only endpoint will be created. Just by putting ""(blank string) symbol in the endpoint, we get the error.

Remember this url "http://127.0.0.1:8000" is equal to this url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".
"/" symbol represents the "base url".


2) I use pycharm with venv.
So, the command is different for running the uvicorn server.
Fastapi documentation has the command "uvicorn main:app --reload". But, this command doesn't work.
So, this command "uvicorn.run("project:app", reload=True)" should be used. Here, we use run() function with arguments.
